% fbstab_sparse: Proximally Stabilized Semismooth Method for solving QPs
% [x,out] = fbstab_mpc(x0,qp,opts) attempts to solve the 
% following quadratic programming problem:
%
% min.  1/2 z'Hz + f'z
% s.t.  Gz = h
%       Az â‰¤ b
%
% Aside from convexity there are no assumptions made about the problem
% This method can detect unboundedness/infeasibility
% and can exploit arbitrary initial guesses. This implementation uses 
% dense linear algebra and dense factorizations.
% 
% Inputs: 
% x0:  A structure with the following fields
%   z: primal initial guess
%   l: equality dual initial guess
%   v: inequality dual initial guess
%
% qp: A structure with the following fields
%   H: n x n Sparse matrix
%   f: n x 1 
%   G: m x n Sparse matrix
%   h: m x 1
%   A: q x n Sparse matrix
%   b: q x 1
%
% opts: Options structure, see fbstab_options.m
% 
% Outputs:
% x: Structure with the following fields
%   z: primal solution
%   l: equality duals
%   v: inequality duals
%
% out: Structure with the following fields
%   prox_iters: number of proximal iterations 
%   newton_iters: number of newton iterations
%   res:  KKT residual
%   eflag: Exit flag
%      0: success
%     -1: Maximum number of iterations exceeded
%     -2: Algorithm stalled
%     -3: Problem is infeasible
%     -4: Problem is unbounded below (dual infeasible)
%     -5: Problem is primal and dual infeasible
